# BlockMed - Decentralized Medical Record Management System
BlockMed is a blockchain-based decentralized medical record management system that ensures secure, tamper-proof, and transparent access to patient health records. This project is currently under development.

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Tools
- **Smart Contract Language**: Solidity `^0.8.21`
- **IDE**: Remix IDE (Browser-based for contract development)
- **Blockchain Network**: Ethereum (Local development using Ganache CLI)
- **Ganache CLI Port**: `8545` (accessed via PyCharm terminal)
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS + Bootstrap (Django Templates)
- **Backend**: Django (Python-based web framework)
- **No MetaMask Integration**: All blockchain interactions are handled via RPC calls directly from the backend.

## 📌 Current Progress

- ✅ Smart Contracts for record handling
- ✅ Doctor Dashboard (view/add patients, write diagnosis)
- ✅ Admin Dashboard (verify doctors, view logs)
- ⏳ Remaining modules under development (e.g., Patient Dashboard, Notification System)
